This project is for Renesas RX621/62N MCU USB function test.
The device works as USB CDC Peripheral same as Renesas's demo project. 
And *.inf file is also same.

Now, the project has a problem(Bug).

The device is recognized as a USB CDC device. We can control from terminal softwares.
When you press a key on the terminal, the device responds 'RX62 USB.'.
But after that, USB FIFO operation doesn't work well.

It's a reason why I upload the project and I need your help.

Thank you for your reading this text.
